Hello, 

My name is Ricky Feir. I'm a research specialist with the Challey Institute at NDSU. 

This website exists as a place for me to share resources or projects that others may use, my CV, and house my public writing. 

Many projects will be uploaded here in an incomplete phase. If so, their title will show "under construction" below the title.
