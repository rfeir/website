                                            <br />
                                            I examine the effects of Good Samaritan laws (GSLs), drug-induced homicide laws (DIH
                                            laws), and naloxone access laws (NALs) on opioid-related deaths. Using a fixed effects OLS and
                                            Poisson approach similar to Rees et al. (2019), I find significant negative correlation early
                                            adopting NAL states, but significant positive correlation among later states. Parsing timespans by
                                            NAL enactment supports these results. DIH law coefficients are consistently positive and often
                                            significant across models and timespans. GSLs, when interacted with DIH laws, have a negative
                                            significant coefficient. When specifying GSLs to include only those states that have no DIH law,
                                            significance and negative magnitude increase. This continues when specifying GSLs whereby
                                            the bystander and victim are both protected and further when specified not to include GSLs
                                            which provide parole or probation protections. Generally, DIH laws and NALs are correlated
                                            with an increase in opioid-related deaths while GSLs are correlated with a decrease</span>

                                            after five years, transitioned to a research role this fall, I’ve experienced firsthand the challenges and rewards of teaching. My departure from education 
                                            is a testament to the broader issue of teacher retention and the difficulty in attracting new talent. So why are fewer individuals joining the profession? 
                                            Why has education seemed to change so rapidly, for the worse? More importantly, how can we foster a stronger academic climate for students in North Dakota?

                                        <span class="preview">The beginning of this school year has brought into sharp relief a persistent challenge facing the United States: a significant teacher 
                                            shortage, most critically felt in fields such as special education, career and technical education (CTE), science, and mathematics. In North Dakota, this 
                                            issue is particularly pronounced, with shortages spanning a wide range of subject areas, leading to an unprecedented declaration of all content areas as
                                            critical shortage zones for the 2023-2024 school year. Faced with this crisis, state education bodies, including North Dakota, have initiated various measures 
                                            to attract and retain teaching talent. These measures include innovative solutions like fast-tracking licensing processes, improving financial incentives such 
                                            as pay raises and student loan repayment assistance, and even international recruitment efforts.</span>

                                            relics of an outdated educational system, these tests can be vital tools in bridging educational disparities. Here's why teachers and parents must encourage 
                                            their students to embrace these exams. Although many colleges and universities have become test-optional, teachers and parents should advocate for students to 
                                            study and take standardized exams. When teachers express skepticism about the fairness or effectiveness of standardized exams, they may perpetuate inequality.</span>

                                        <span class="preview">What images come to mind when you think of life on a reservation? Isolated lands, scarce resources, and hardship? It’s time to challenge these 
                                            stereotypes. Long before European settlement, Native American communities thrived with entrepreneurship and trade. Consider the Native blacksmiths in North Dakota’s 
                                            Mandan Villages who produced and traded axes that reached the North Pacific coasts quickly. Or the ancestral Puebloan culture in New Mexico's Chaco Canyon around 850 
                                            AD, a regional trade and administration hub. These examples underscore a history of economic success rooted in respected property rights. Despite their rich natural 
                                            resources, U.S. government policies hindered native economic well-being. Since colonization, American Indians have been wrapped in “white tape,” as the late Coushatta 
                                            Tribal chairman Ernest Stickey calls their bureaucratic quagmire. This has hampered their ability to build new businesses and become entrepreneurs. Since being 
                                            declared “wards” of the federal government in 1831, Native Americans have faced cultural and religious suppression. This has contributed to the current reality where 
                                            one in four reservation Indians live in poverty, many depending on federal grants.</span>
